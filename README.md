# 🍜 Savoury Sense – Frontend (React)

**Savoury Sense** is an AI-powered culinary web application built with the **MERN stack**. This repository contains the **Frontend (React)** code developed solely by me responsible for delivering a seamless user experience, intelligent recipe generation, mood-based meal suggestions, and community interaction.

## ✨ Key Features

### 👨‍🍳 Chef AI
- Users enter available ingredients.
- The frontend interacts with a backend ML model (CNN + Transformer hybrid) to generate creative recipes.
- Recipes are dynamically rendered in a stylish card/grid format.

### 😋 Eat by Mood
- Users choose a mood (happy, sad, angry, etc.).
- Frontend sends this mood to the backend which returns a comfort recipe.
- Users can **listen to the recipe in English or Hindi** using speech synthesis (with pause/resume support).

### 🗣️ Cook Alike
- Recommends similar recipes based on **sentiment analysis** of user reviews.
- Displays graphically the similarity breakdown: sentiment score, rating, fuzzy match.

### 🤖 Conversational Assistant (AI Chatbot)
- Integrated with Groq API or similar LLMs.
- Real-time Q&A, cooking suggestions, and interactive voice/text support.
- Embedded chat widget within the frontend.

### 📸 Savoury Social
- Social feed to browse, like, post, and comment on community recipes.
- Built with React components and state-managed interactions.
